# Content-Scheduler
A simple website to schedule contents that need to be uploaded in  a certain amount of time.

# How it works?
The website allows you to manage the contents by letting you create a list of contents for a month, each content will be assigned a color so you can effectively see it on the calender.
Each content will have several posts to be uploaded in the month. Each post will be assigned with a color so it can be shown on the calender as well.
